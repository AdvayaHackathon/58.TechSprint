Answer: Early stopping is a regularization technique used during the training of neural networks to prevent overfitting. It works by monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set. As training progresses, if the performance on the validation set starts to degrade (i.e., validation error increases), early stopping stops the training process early to prevent the model from learning noise from the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data. By halting training at the right moment, early stopping ensures that the model generalizes well and improves its ability to make accurate predictions on new data.

Question: Describe the concept of a support vector machine (SVM) in machine learning.
Answer: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes in a high-dimensional space. The hyperplane is chosen to maximize the margin, or distance, between the closest data points of different classes, ensuring robust generalization to unseen data. SVMs are effective in handling high-dimensional data and are particularly well-suited for problems where the data is not linearly separable. They can also be extended using kernel methods to handle non-linear decision boundaries by implicitly mapping the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space. SVMs have been widely used in various applications, including image classification, text categorization, and bioinformatics.
